# Self-Paced Research on Building Chat Bots and Agents

This document outlines a **sequence of tasks** for a **self-paced research effort** on building chatbots and AI agents. Each step should be completed in order, but there are **no strict deadlines**. The goal is to **document your progress** as you go.

> **Collaboration Policy:**  
> You are allowed to work with others and post questions on Blackboard.  
> However, **copying someone else's work** is considered **plagiarism** and may lead to **termination** of your internship.

## **1. Explore Python Development Environments**
- You will be using **Python** with **Streamlit**.
- Explore two development environments:
  1. **Codespaces** - [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
  2. **Your Choice** - Must be **compatible with Streamlit** ([Streamlit.io](https://streamlit.io))

### **Tasks**
- Write a **Getting Started Guide** for both environments:
  - Explain how to **set up an account/environment**.
  - Provide steps to build a **simple "Hello World" Streamlit app**.
  - Use **screenshots** where necessary.
- Choose **one environment** for the rest of the project and explain why.

---

## **2. Deploy a Web-Based Application**
- Ensure your web app has a **public URL**.
- If necessary, update your choice of the development environment.
- **Hint:** In **Codespaces**, this is easy, but there are **other simple solutions**.

---

## **3. Build a Simple Chatbot**
- Use **Streamlit's** `chat_input` and `chat_message`.
- The bot should:
  - Accept user input.
  - Respond with **"Thank you for telling me XXX"**, where `XXX` is user input.
  - Show **chat history**.
- Document:
  - **Best practices**
  - **Challenges faced**

---

## **4. Build a Chatbot with Short-Term Memory**
- Use **OpenAI**, **Cohere**, or another **LLM**.
- Implement a **conversation loop**:
  - Get user input.
  - Pass it to the **LLM**.
  - Maintain **conversation history**.
- Document:
  - **Best practices**
  - **Challenges faced**

---

## **5. Improve the Chatbot's UI**
- **Stream answers** for better user experience.
- Add a **screen** to ask for the **OpenAI API Key** (or other LLM key).

---

## **6. Explore Prompt Engineering**
- Experiment with different **prompting techniques**:
  - Adjust **tone** of responses.
  - Modify **level of detail**.
  - Explore **other interesting aspects**.
- Ensure the bot says **"I do not know"** if it lacks information.
- Implement **system prompts**:
  - Define the chatbot's behavior.
  - Document **best practices** and **challenges**.

---

## **7. Knowledge-Based Q&A Bot**
- Research **vector databases** and prepare **~20 slides** explaining them.
- Build a bot that **answers questions about iSchool graduate courses**.
  - Use [Syracuse iSchool Course Syllabi](https://answers.syr.edu/display/ischool/iSchool+Graduate+Courses).
- Steps:
  - Find the best way to **load** course data into your chatbot.
  - Provide **step-by-step instructions** on how you created the **vector database**.
  - Prepare a **~20-slide presentation** explaining your **Q&A bot**.
- Document:
  - **Best practices**
  - **Challenges faced**

---

## **8. Implement Functions in a Chatbot**
- Research **functions in LLMs** and prepare **~20 slides**.
- Define and implement a **useful function** for your chatbot.
  - Describe **what it does** and **why itâ€™s useful**.
- Document:
  - **Best practices**
  - **Challenges faced**

---

## **9. Build an Agent for Document Summarization**
- Create a new **user interface** that:
  - Accepts a **document (PDF or URL)**.
  - Allows user to select **summary length** (**short/long**).
  - Generates a **summary** of the document.

---

## **10. Explore an Advanced Topic**
- Possible topics:
  - **Long-term memory** for a chatbot.
  - Using **LangChain** or another **higher-level library**.
  - Building a chatbot with **unique features**.
- Provide:
  - A **summary** of what you plan to do.
  - Your **learning plan**.
  - Reasons **why this topic is interesting/valuable**.
- **Document progress**:
  - **Best practices**
  - **Challenges faced**

---
